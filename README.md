## Project Description

This project was originally started in week 3 of my MIT Professional Certificate in Coding course and was altered in week 4. Upon opening the file you'll see existing dots that randomly move, similar to a random brushstroke. You're able to add more colorful dots to make your own mark on the random art.

## Installation

Download all files to the same location on your machine. Drag the virtualPainting.html file on to your browser. Click anywhere on the screen to add more dots.

## Roadmap

Future updates to this project will include more colors and different size dots.
